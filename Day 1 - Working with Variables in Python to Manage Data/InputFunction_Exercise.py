# Inputs
# Instructions
# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

# e.g.

# https: // www.google.com/search?q = how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow

# Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

# Example Input
# Angela

# Example Output
# 6
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

# https: // cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/opevxYZSTM2ZHjbAX3XV

# Hint
# You can put functions inside other functions.
# Don't try to print anything other than the length.

print(len(input("What is your name?: ")))
